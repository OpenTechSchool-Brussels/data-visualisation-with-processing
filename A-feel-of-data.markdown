This is the most important section, and might end up being the whole of the workshop. Here, the aim is not to study or learn classical instances of data visualisations (charts, graphs...) and neither to focus on specific tools that allow you to do a discret finite set of things. Here, the aim is to get at the core of data visualisation, having a feel of the data. What representing it means, and how we can give a more human meaning to those numbers, to enlight a perspective, to open them for exploration.

In the following, we will see many simple examples, fitting both learning how to code and getting a feel of what data and its visualisation can mean. 

##a) Basic structures of data
Here for the boring part. Let's learn or review a few principales about data: variables, arrays & objects. For those that will be discovering those principles, don't overthink how complicated it might first appears. Even more, you're already handling data while learning this part, and it's part of creating your most valuable asset: your sensibility.

Variables Numbers & Text

Arrays & Object

#b) Show me the numbers!
FOR LOOP
Display text numbers : random data
    Display many sets of data

##c) Shapes & Colors
Display shapes & size (rectangle) : random data
Display shapes & color (ellipse) : random data

##d) Placing shapes
placing your object in space : random -> bubble graphs

Display Bar charts (frequency): random data

Heat Maps


##e) Making sense of it
Parsing, filtering ...
DNA, Fisher's Iris Data set, Text
Tree (for text, words that follow ...)
Something about ADN ?
