title:  "A feel of Data"

This is the most important section, and might end up being the whole of the workshop. Here, the aim is not to study or learn classical instances of data visualizations (charts, graphs...) and neither to focus on specific tools that allow you to do a discrete finite set of things. Here, the aim is to get at the core of data visualization, having a feel of the data. What representing it means, and how we can give a more human meaning to those numbers, to enlighten a perspective, to open them for exploration.

In the following, we will see many simple examples, fitting both learning how to code and getting a feel of what data and its visualization can mean. 

##a) Basic structures of data
Before using data and visualizing it, we need to have some. In programming languages, we have many ways to store information, let's review the basic one and create some data set we'll be using in this section.

The atomic information holder is called a variable. A variable is defined by three things. Its name, what kind of information it stores, and its value. You can store text, integers, float, colors, vectors ... many many things. A complete definition of a variable is as follow: `float myVariable = 20.45;`.

We have in order the variable’s type (`float`), its name (`myVariable`), and the value it’ll be affected (`20.45`). The symbol `=` here doesn’t defines an equality but an affectation. It reads as “let’s calculate what is on the right side of the symbol, and affect the variable on the left with that value”.

While there are many possible types, we'll be using manly three : `floats` for decimal values (like 19.53, 0.1, -45.1), `int` for integers (0, 10, -23) and `string` for text ("h", "hello", text is always between quote marks). 

Not getting into too much details, but variables have scopes. Where you define them define where you can use them. If you want to use them locally, define them at a specific place in your program, if you want to use them everywhere, then define them at the root, at the start of your program.


Let's learn or review a few principales about data: variables, arrays & objects. For those that will be discovering those principles, don't overthink how complicated it might first appears. Even more, you're already handling data while learning this part, and it's part of creating your most valuable asset: your sensibility.

Variables Numbers & Text

Arrays & Object

#b) Show me the numbers!
FOR LOOP
Display text numbers : random data
    Display many sets of data

##c) Shapes & Colors
Display shapes & size (rectangle) : random data
Display shapes & color (ellipse) : random data

##d) Placing shapes
placing your object in space : random -> bubble graphs

Display Bar charts (frequency): random data

Heat Maps


##e) Making sense of it
Parsing, filtering ...
DNA, Fisher's Iris Data set, Text
Tree (for text, words that follow ...)
Something about ADN ?
