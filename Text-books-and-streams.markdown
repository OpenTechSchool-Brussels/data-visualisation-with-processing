One type of data that is too often forgotten is text data. A shame, since this is where processing filter are kings & queens. Using linguistic and semantics, you can push forward, mine text, and display them in a way you wouldn't have thought possible for a boring linear piece of text.

We have in mind to let you play with three kind of text: twitter streams, books and DNA sequences. Let's already start with twitter, we'll see if your lovely organizer had time to stuff the workshop material with more goodness (probably not this time...).

## a) Using libraries, again & Twitter dev stuff

First of all .... sometimes you care, sometimes you don't. While at OTS we pride ourselves on explaining each line of code, sometimes while using more heavy libraries, some part of code might appear that are extremely useful but might be a bit out of league as for assimilation. Not saying it's not important to understand it, but there is a safe margin between "getting it" and being able to recode the whole library... This will be the case here.

But before looking at the code, let's already download the library, which ... is not a Processing library. Oh my god! But then how can they communicate? Alien translator? Telepathy? Almost. While Processing is a language on its own, it's actually a over-set of another well known programming language: Java. Whatever you might know or will learn in Java,  you can reuse in Processing. This is doubly interesting: first, you have all the power of Java at your hands, all its structure, functions...; second, you can reuse any Java library, like the one we'll be using to feed on Twitter. Download it [here](http://twitter4j.org/archive/twitter4j-4.0.2.zip). In the *lib* folder, you will found the *twitter4j-core-4.0.2.jar* file. Extract it in safe place and then drag and drop the extracted file on your opened processing sketch. You should see at the bottom "one file added to the sketch".

Alas, with this kind of usage, Twitter request you to have some identification. For that, you need to register a twitter account. Then visit https://app.twitter.com/ and login. Click on *Create an app*, fill out the form (you can put random info) and agree to the developer terms. You should arrive at a page with among others the *Consumer key* and the *Consumer secret*. Click on *Generate my access Token* and you should get the two last info we need: the *Access Token* and the *Access Token Secret*. Ahhh, now let's use it and see what is tweeted all around the world!

##b) Reading some tweets

##c) Filtering your text
simple display with red
split, textWidth

##d) A better display (or both at the same time?)
PFont



 
Process: filter with start of sentences
Plot: Organised text (potentialy dynamic)

I am...
I have ....

... loves ...
... hates ...

... then ...

Even better : stream (for next episode...)

## b) Books
 Getting books from project Guntenberg (and DNA). (Better downloading it than taking it form the web straight from application)
 Parsing lines.
 
 Same than previously can be done.
 
 Frequency of a word in a book
 Study the evolution of usage of a word over time (biggggg data base).
 
 Tree: following of words (N tuplets...)


## c) DNA

Something about ADN ?
